1. Class and Obj (example)
2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods
    > Code walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3. Why Python is called OOP? - everything in Python is an object (data structure, data type etc)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab


5. End to end Project (Chatbook class)
    > function vs method
    > magic method or dunder method
    > self
    > You can create attribute outside class as well

    > encapsulation     # To hide the attribute
    > getter and setter # to get the hidden attribute and get the hidden attribute
    > static method

6. Inhertance
    >Inhertance code example
    >why Inhertance is needed? (code reusability, parent has no access to child class)
    >what gets inherited? --> Constructor, Non private attributes, non private methods
    >Constructor overloading & method overloading
    >Super keyword(can be used only inside class, can not access varaibles/attributes, used only inside child class)
    >Type of Inhertance 
        >1. Single Inhertance
        >2. Multilvel
        >3. Hirearchical
        >4. Multiple 
        >5. Hybrid
